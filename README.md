# 'Using Machine Learning to Diagnose Malaria'


# Project Summary & Background

The purpose of this project is to explore deep learning techniques and CNNs in order to create a model that accurately predicts malaria infection in blood smear data. According to the CDC, malaria is, "...a serious and sometimes fatal disease caused by a parasite that commonly infects a certain type of mosquito which feeds on humans." Those with malaria generally develop mild to severe fever and flu-like symptoms; in some cases, serious complications occur that can be life-threatening such as blood clots, severe anemia, seizures, and comas. Each year, nearly 290 million people become infected with malaria, and over 400,000 end up dying from the disease (MayoClinic, 2021). 

The process of detecting infection is usually done by trained laboratory professionals using a microscope-- a process that can take over an hour per sample. In underserved areas, this can be a problem because there are often too many patients and not enough resources. By automating the process with machine learning, this can improve accuracy/efficiency,  reduce cost, and help more patients affected by this disease.
